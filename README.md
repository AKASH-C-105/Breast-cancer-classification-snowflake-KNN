# Breast-cancer-classification-snowflake-KNN
This project implements a distance-based K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant. The dataset is processed, analyzed, and classified using supervised machine learning techniques, demonstrating how distance metrics can be effectively used for medical diagnosis problems.
